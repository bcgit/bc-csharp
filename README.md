# The Bouncy Castle Crypto Package For C Sharp

The Bouncy Castle Crypto package is a C\# implementation of cryptographic algorithms and protocols, it was developed by the Legion of the Bouncy Castle, a registered Australian Charity, with a little help! The Legion, and the latest goings on with this package, can be found at [http://www.bouncycastle.org](http://www.bouncycastle.org). In addition to providing basic cryptography algorithms, the package also provides support for CMS, TSP, X.509 certificate generation and a variety of other standards such as OpenPGP.

The Legion also gratefully acknowledges the contributions made to this package by others (see [here](http://www.bouncycastle.org/csharp/contributors.html) for the current list). If you would like to contribute to our efforts please feel free to get in touch with us or visit our [donations page](https://www.bouncycastle.org/donate), sponsor some specific work, or purchase a support contract through [Crypto Workshop](http://www.cryptoworkshop.com).
