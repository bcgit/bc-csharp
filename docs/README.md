The Bouncy Castle Cryptography library is a .NET implementation of cryptographic algorithms and protocols. It was developed by the Legion of the Bouncy Castle, a registered Australian Charity, with a little help! The Legion, and the latest goings on with this package, can be found at [https://www.bouncycastle.org](https://www.bouncycastle.org).

In addition to providing basic cryptography algorithms, the package also provides support for CMS, OpenPGP, (D)TLS, TSP, X.509 certificate generation and more. The package also includes implementations of the following NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization algorithms: CRYSTALS-Dilithium, CRYSTALS-Kyber, Falcon, SPHINCS+, Classic McEliece, FrodoKEM, NTRU, NTRU Prime, Picnic, Saber, BIKE, and SIKE. These should all be considered EXPERIMENTAL and subject to change or removal. SIKE in particular is already slated for removal and should be used for research purposes only.
