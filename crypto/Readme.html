        <p>
            Some of the algorithms in the Bouncy Castle APIs are patented in some places. It is up to the user of the library to be aware
            of their own legal situation, however we have been asked to specifically mention the patents below, in the following terms,
            at the request of the patent holder.
        </p>
        <p>
The BC distribution contains implementations of EC MQV as described in RFC 5753, "Use of ECC Algorithms in CMS". In line with the conditions in:

We state, where EC MQV has not otherwise been disabled or removed:
"The use of this product or service is subject to the reasonable, non-discriminatory terms in the Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Disclosures of Certicom Corp. at the IETF for Use of Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) Algorithms in Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) implemented in the product or service."

        <p>
            (NOTE: This build system is essentially obsolete and will be withdrawn after the 1.8 series. We have
            introduced MSBuild project files which will probably be a preferred option if you want to build yourself.)
        </p>
		<p>
			The BC C# API uses NAnt (<a href="http://nant.sourceforge.net/">http://nant.sourceforge.net</a>) 
			to provide a platform independent build environment (suggested version NAnt 0.90).
			There is also a solution file for Visual Studio, and for MonoDevelop. The API works
			with .NET Framework 1.1 and above. It has been successfully built and tested with Mono
			versions from 1.1.13 onwards. The source code can be built for .NET Compact Framework 1.0
			by setting the compilation flag NETCF_1_0, or .NET Compact Framework 2.0 by setting NETCF_2_0,
			or Silverlight 2 by setting SILVERLIGHT.

		The Bouncy Castle C# API is a port of the Bouncy Castle Java APIs. 
		Approximately %80 of the functionality in the Java build has now been ported. 
		For the most part, the naming conventions of the .NET platform have been 
		adopted. The C# API is constantly kept uptodate with bug fixes and new test 
		cases from the Java build (and vice versa sometimes), thus benefitting from the 
		large user base and real-world use the Java version has seen.<br/>
		<br/>
		<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Please consider.</span><br/>
		<br/>
		The Bouncy Castle C# API is a library of transformations that when combined properly will enable
        developers to create standard conforming cryptographic systems. In order to use this API you must have
        some knowledge of how to build cryptographic systems, namely what transformations to use and the when,
        where and why of their use. Developing good cryptographic systems takes practice and understanding.<br/>
		<br/>
		There are many resources available online and in book shops; please use those to your advantage.<br/>

        <h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId85316"></a>Release 1.8.2, Release Date TBD</h4>

        <h5>Security Advisory</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Carry propagation bugs in the implementation of squaring for several raw math classes have been fixed (Org.BouncyCastle.Math.Raw.Nat???).
                These classes are used by our custom elliptic curve implementations (Org.BouncyCastle.Math.Ec.Custom.**), so there was the possibility
                of rare (in general usage) spurious calculations for elliptic curve scalar multiplications. Such errors would have been detected with
                high probability by the output validation for our scalar multipliers. We consider these bugs to be exploitable for static ECDH with
                long-term keys, per <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2011/633">"Practical realisation and elimination of an ECC-related software bug attack",
                Brumley et.al.</a>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h5>IMPORTANT</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>
                This release brings our Poly1305 implementation into line wih RFC 7539, which breaks backward compatibility. The essential
                difference from 1.8.1 is that the two halves of the 32-byte Poly1305 key have swapped places. If you have persisted Poly1305
                keys, or are interoperating with other Poly1305 implementations, you may need to account for this change when migrating to 1.8.2.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Additional Features and Functionality</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>TLS: support for ClientHello Padding Extension (RFC 7685).</li>
            <li>TLS: support for ECDH_anon key exchange.</li>
            <li>BCrypt implementation added.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId85315"></a>Release 1.8.1, Monday December 28, 2015</h4>

        <h5>Security Advisory</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>
                (D)TLS 1.2: Motivated by <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=CVE-2015-7575">CVE-2015-7575</a>, we have added validation that
                the signature algorithm received in DigitallySigned structures is actually one of those offered (in signature_algorithms extension
                or CertificateRequest). With our default TLS configuration, we do not believe there is an exploitable vulnerability in any earlier
                releases. Users that are customizing the signature_algorithms extension, or running a server supporting client authentication, are
                advised to double-check that they are not offering any signature algorithms involving MD5.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Additional Features and Functionality</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Added support for ASN.1 GraphicString and VideotexString types.</li>
            <li>
                Problems with DTLS record-layer version handling were resolved via <a href="http://www.bouncycastle.org/jira/browse/BJA-584">BJA-584</a>,
                making version negotiation work properly.
            </li>
        </ul>

        </ul>

        <h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId85314"></a>Release 1.8.0, Sunday November 22, 2015</h4>

        <h5>IMPORTANT</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>The Serpent cipher as of 1.8.0 is incompatible with the behaviour of Serpent in earlier releases; it has been
            modified to conform to the standard byte-order interpretation for blocks (and keys). The previous behaviour is
            available from 1.8.0 as the "Tnepres" cipher. See <a href="http://www.bouncycastle.org/jira/browse/BMA-52">BMA-52</a>
            for more information if this may affect you.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Additional Features and Functionality</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>IV only re-initialisation is supported by using null as the key parameter when creating a ParametersWithIV object.</li>
            <li>CMS Enveloped and AuthenticatedData now support OriginatorInfo.</li>
            <li>Support for ECDSA_fixed_ECDH authentication has been added to the TLS client.</li>
            <li>Support for the Features signature sub-packet has been added to the PGP API.</li>
            <li>Classes involved in CRL manipulation have been rewritten to reduce memory requirements for handling and parsing extremely large CRLs.</li>
            <li>An implementation of Password Authenticated Key Exchange by Juggling (J-PAKE) has been added.</li>
